# Spring Data Redis Repository
Spring Data  makes it very easy to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations,
without having to know the low level details of the data solutions like Redis or GemFire for Redis
applications.

All you need is a Repository interface. Spring Data implements
the low level data access details using the data solutions API(s).

See [CustomerFavoriteRepository](https://github.com/Tanzu-Solutions-Engineering/spring-modern-data-architecture/blob/main/components/retail-repositories-caching/src/main/java/com/vmware/retail/repository/CustomerFavoriteRepository.java)

```java
@Repository
public interface CustomerFavoriteRepository extends KeyValueRepository<CustomerFavorites,String>
{
}
```
