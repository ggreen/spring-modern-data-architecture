Most applications are not useful without data. Come and see how easy it is to integrate, analyze and consume data using Spring.

Weâ€™ll walk through how to use spring projects such as Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud DataFlow to build data pipelines for data movement. Learn how easy it is to consume data services in your Spring Boot applications using Spring Data. We will demonstrate running realtime data analytics on Kubernetes, powered by Spring.

Spring Data is the de-facto standard for data access within the Spring ecosystem, and Spring Cloud provides multi-cloud data integration for a large number of real-life use cases, including data analytics. Spring Cloud DataFlow makes it easy to work with VMware products such as VMware Data (SQL, GemFire, RabbitMQ) and Observability.
